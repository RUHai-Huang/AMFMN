### Dataset Features
![The similarity visualization results of six datasets](../figures/dataset_compare_line.jpg)
The similarity visualization results of six datasets, where the similarity score is weighted by the BLEU and METEOR indicators in the natural
language processing field. The ideal picture is a straight diagonal line from the upper left to the lower right, which means each sentence is only related to the
corresponding image.

##
![Quantitative comparison of the four datasets](../figures/dataset_compare_number.jpg)
Quantitative comparison of the four datasets. (a) Comparison of sample number. (b) Comparison of average sentence length. (c) Comparison of
diversity score. (d) Comparison of average similarity. (e) Comparison of the total number of words. (f) Comparison of the number of categories.
